    "#### Deborah Hanus\n",
    "Deborah Hanus graduated MIT with a Masters in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. As a Fulbright Scholar in Cambodia, she learned about how education translates into job creation in technology. After working as an early engineer at a software company, she decided to take a hiatus to work on exciting data-related projects as a machine learning researcher at Harvard University.\n",
    "#### Abstract\n",
    "Using Jupyter notebooks and scikit-learn, you’ll predict whether a movie is likely to win an Oscar or be a box office hit. Together, we’ll step through the creation of an effective dataset: asking a question your data can answer, writing a web scraper, and answering those questions using nothing but Python libraries and data from the Internet. \n",
