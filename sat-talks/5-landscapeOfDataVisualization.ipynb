    "Jake VanderPlas is a data science fellow at the University of Washington's eScience Institute, where his work focuses on data-intensive physical science research in an interdisciplinary setting. In the Python world, Jake is the author of the Python Data Science Handbook, and is active in maintaining and/or contributing to several well-known Python scientific computing packages, including Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Astropy, Altair, and others. He occasionally blogs on python-related topics at http://jakevdp.github.io/\n",
    "#### Abstract\n",
    "So you want to visualize some data in Python: which library do you choose? From Matplotlib to Seaborn to Bokeh to Plotly, Python has a range of mature tools to create beautiful visualizations, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this talk Iâ€™ll give an overview of the landscape of dataviz tools in Python, as well as some deeper dives into a few, so that you can intelligently choose which library to turn to for any given visualization task.\n",
